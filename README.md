Exercises
=========

Fix the TODO's

Commit to bitbucket and paste the link of the commit to http://goo.gl/9Ntav5

You can make as many commits as you want (very good!).

The naming convention of commit when you are finished with an exercise is: "exercise ww.nn" where ww is the week number and nn is the exercise number, e.g. "exercise 02.12".
